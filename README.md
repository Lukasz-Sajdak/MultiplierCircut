## Main Functional Blocks
The schematic is divided into the following key sections:

### Power Supply
- **Purpose:** Voltage stabilization for the circuit.
- **Components:**
  - **V+ Regulation:** The circuit uses a standard power supply for V+.
  - **V- Generation:** The negative voltage is generated using the **ICL7660AIBAZA** charge pump.

### Charge Pump
- **Purpose:** Generates the negative voltage required for specific circuit components.

### Voltage-Frequency Converter
- **Purpose:** This block, based on the **LM331**, controls and filters the input signal.
- **Adjustment:** The signal can be adjusted using an **R3 potentiometer** for finer control over the frequency.
- **Issue:** The VCF isn't operating as expected due to incorrect resistor choices and insufficient current flowing into the IC.

### Adding Offset
- **Purpose:** Adds a frequency shift to the input signal, ensuring correct operation when dealing with a 0V input.
- **Components:** Implemented with the **TS912** operational amplifier.

### Subtracting Offset
- **Purpose:** Compensates for any voltage offset by subtracting a specific value.
- **Components:** The **TS912** operational amplifier is used here as well, with the offset adjusted via the **R18 potentiometer**.

### Voltage Reference
- **Purpose:** Provides a reference voltage for the circuit.
- **Component:** **TL431BIDBZR** is used for this purpose.

### Analog Switch
- **Component:** **DG419DY**  
- **Purpose:** Transfers charge based on V/F signal to perform multiplication with Vy. Connected to capacitor and output stage.

## How It Works

The circuit receives two input signals: **Vx** and **Vy**, and performs an analog multiplication of these signals.

The **Vx** signal is fed into a voltage-to-frequency converter (**V/F**, based on LM331), which converts the voltage into a frequency proportional to **Vx**. This frequency output is then used to control an analog switch.

The analog switch operates by transferring charge from the **Vy** signal to a capacitor in response to the frequency generated by the V/F converter.

**Switch connections:**
- **IN** — control signal from V/F (frequency depends on **Vx**)  
- **S2** — voltage input **Vy**  
- **D** — capacitor  
- **S1** — output  

As a result, the amount of transferred charge—and thus the output voltage—depends on both the **Vy** amplitude and the frequency determined by **Vx**. This results in **analog multiplication** of **Vx** and **Vy**.

## Known Issues
- The **VCF** is not functioning correctly due to improper resistor selection and insufficient current flow to the integrated circuit. This needs to be addressed for proper operation.

## PCB Design
The physical implementation of the circuit has been designed using **KiCad EDA 8.0.2** software.
